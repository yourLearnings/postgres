# Just another sleepless night 


## Yes a few months back, just another scary sleepless night.
 This time I was on tour and decided to opt for private stay homes, that too for the first time. The last-minute planning went fuzzy, 
 I decided to share the stay arrangements with my friend in Bangalore. They could help me finalise, the stay, which was at a walkable distance from the place, I planned to visit.
